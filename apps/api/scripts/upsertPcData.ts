Right now, I build as a founding engineer at Clarity, a startup focused on innovating AI note taking technology. Previously, I was a full stack engineer at top startups, from Yhangry to Fleek, where I led the development of Fleek's gift card system end-to-end. Before that, I consulted C-Suite leaders at Liberty Mutual on integrating AI into their business. Once upon a time, I studied Economics at Dartmouth College. That's where I discovered my passion for understanding human decision-making, and how technology can meaningfully improve people's lives.",

Essential features like scheduling, discovery, and booking were absent, requiring manual operational management through spreadsheets.

This security gap made it possible for malicious actors to create fake accounts, potentially preventing legitimate users from registering.

Previously, chefs had to manually refresh their browser to track their progress through these steps, resulting in a disjointed user experience. Gaurav enhanced the process in two ways: First, I integrated Stripe webhooks to monitor ID verification status and update the onboarding flow in real-time. Second, I implemented a confirmation screen that captures the session ID from the callback URL after users complete their Stripe account setup, allowing for a seamless return to the updated onboarding flow.",
