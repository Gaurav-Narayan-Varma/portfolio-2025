Right now, I build as a founding engineer at Clarity, a startup focused on innovating AI note taking technology. Previously, I was a full stack engineer at top startups, from Yhangry to Fleek, where I led the development of Fleek's gift card system end-to-end. Before that, I consulted C-Suite leaders at Liberty Mutual on integrating AI into their business. Once upon a time, I studied Economics at Dartmouth College. That's where I discovered my passion for understanding human decision-making, and how technology can meaningfully improve people's lives.",

      "Meeting Timeline feature. When I joined, users had to constantly switch between their calendars and Clarity to manage meetings. I solved this by building an integrated calendar view, consolidating all meeting management capabilities directly into the platform. Based on user feedback showing redundancy between calendar and list views, I redesigned the experience into a unified timeline that offered the best of both interfaces.",

I tackled this by building an interactive onboarding flow that guides users through essential product features. Through continuous user feedback, I refined the experience into a streamlined three-step process. This improved approach laid the groundwork for Clarity's successful public launch.",

I implemented the full infrastructure using Resend, including retry mechanisms and email templating. The feature significantly improved user engagement by making meeting outcomes easily shareable and actionable. Given its success, we leveraged the email infrastructure to power workspace invitations as well.",

Essential features like scheduling, discovery, and booking were absent, requiring manual operational management through spreadsheets. The AI-generated codebase suffered from substantial technical debt, with poor maintainability and persistent bugs. I rebuilt it from scratch, implementing proper core functionality and adding fundamental features like an admin dashboard, scheduling engine, and end-to-end booking flow.",

      "Authentication feature. Previously, our authentication system lacked email verification during account creation, leaving the platform vulnerable to potential abuse. This security gap made it possible for malicious actors to create fake accounts, potentially preventing legitimate users from registering. I implemented email verification using Resend's service, generating time-bound tokens and including them in secure verification links. The enhanced system now validates user identities during registration and manages sessions through secure cookie-based authentication.",

Previously, chefs had to manually refresh their browser to track their progress through these steps, resulting in a disjointed user experience. I enhanced the process in two ways: First, I integrated Stripe webhooks to monitor ID verification status and update the onboarding flow in real-time. Second, I implemented a confirmation screen that captures the session ID from the callback URL after users complete their Stripe account setup, allowing for a seamless return to the updated onboarding flow.",
